        <p>The donation to the Musk Foundation instantly made it one of the 
            largest foundations in the United States, with $9.4 billion in 
            assets at the end of 2021, according to a tax filing obtained 
            by Bloomberg. The filing details $160 million in donations from 
            the foundation to nonprofits last year, including $55 million to 
            St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital, $54 million to the XPrize Foundation,
            and donations Musk publicly promised to school districts and nonprofits in 
            the area around Brownsville, Texas, near the SpaceX spaceport.</p>
