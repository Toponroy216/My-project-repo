            assets at the end of 2021, according to a tax filing obtained 
            by Bloomberg. The filing details $160 million in donations from 
            the foundation to nonprofits last year, including $55 million to 
            St. Jude Childrenâ€™s Research Hospital, $54 million to the XPrize Foundation,
            and donations Musk publicly promised to school districts and nonprofits in
